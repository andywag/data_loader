# data_loader

The purpose of this project is to provide a streaming dataloader for NLP which runs independently of the project. The project currently supports training but will also server inference longer term. The motivation behind this was based on solving 2 issues : 

1. Issues with Python Performance Related to PreProcessing data
2. Support for handling Streaming Interfaces

## Status

This project is in a relatively early stage and is not ready for use. The current supported cases are BERT pretraining with support for other tasks in progress.
